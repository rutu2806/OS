Note:Many operation might not work.Analyze them
1.	Create Three level nested directory a,b and c
a)Create at least one hidden file in each directory

> mkdir -p a/b/c

b)Create at least one normal text file in each directory

> touch filea.txt ./b/fileb.txt ./b/c/filec.txt

c)Copy c into a

> cp -r b/c ./

d)Copy file inside a into b

> cp filea.txt b/

2.	Change the third level directory c permission to read only

	> chmod a+r b/c
 
3.	Try copying third level c directory to outside of a

	> cp b/c ../

4.	Create the directory  “data“ inside b

	> mkdir b/data

5.	Change the permission of b to read and write only

	> chmod u+rw b

6.	Create directory “data2”  inside b

	> mkdir b/data2

7.	Create data.txt file inside b
	
	> touch b/data.txt

8.	Rename the second level directory c to copied_dir

	> mv b/c a

9.	Change permission of copied_dir to only executable

	> chmod u+x b/c

10.	Try ls on copied_dir

	> ls cannot run because of executable only cannot read

11.	Try moving copied_dir to outside of a

	> cannot move dir to outside because of restriced permissions

12.	Try moving data directory outside of a

	> cannot move, permission access denied

13.	Now change the owner of the directory a to root

	> groups username
	
	chgrp webdev file.txt

	ls -l file.txt

14.	Change permission of a to read write and executable to only user

	> chmod u+rwx a

15.	Try creating directory sample inside a

	> mkdir a/d

16.	Create directory x outside a

	> mkdir ../x

17.	Try moving x inside a

	> mv x ./a

18.	Create directory movies

	> mkdir movies

19.	Change group of movies to sudo

	> sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser


20.	Change group of movies to avahi

	> chgrp scifi myfile
	
	  ls -l myfile
 
21.	Try changing permission after changing ownership to root

	> sudo chmod --recursive a+rwx /tmp


22.	Try Changing permission after changing group to sudo without sudo

	> pkexec chmod go-w /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so


23.	Try Changing owner and group both to root

	> sudo chown -R username:group directory


24.	Try changinging permission

	> sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser

25.	Try deleting the file

	> rm -rf a.txt
